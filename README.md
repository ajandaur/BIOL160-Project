# BIOL160-Project
The purpose of this study was to find major sources of stress among students at Santa Clara University. College students are particularly prone to stress due to rigorous classes, participation in clubs, leadership positions, varying academic schools and majors, affiliation with a fraternity or sorority, and maintaining relationships.

The variables included in this study were a combination of possible stressors from academics, extracurriculars, sleeping habits, and relationships. The specific variables studied as possible sources of stress at SCU include the school that one is in (Arts and Sciences, Business, or Engineering), school year, average hours of sleep, average hours spent on homework in a week, participation in a fraternity or sorority, relationship status, participation in athletics, affiliation in a club, leadership position in a club, current amount of units taken, major, number of majors and minors, jobs, GPA, and gender. 
Our main question is, what variables increase stress among SCU students? To answer this, we compared the school that one is in to the number of units being taken, relationship status to stress level, gender to hours spent studying, gender to school, school year to leadership position, leadership position to stress level, stress level to GPA, stress level to number of units taken, number of units and GPA to stress level, in a fraternity/sorority to GPA, and finally, school to year to GPA.
